## Simple NFT Marketplace

Challenge:

>Sellers can sell() their NFT while specifying a price and expiration. Instead of depositing the NFT into the contract, they give the contract approval to withdraw it from them. If a buyer comes along and pays the specified price before the expiration, then the NFT is transferred from the seller to the buyer and the buyer”s ether is transferred to the seller.
The seller can cancel() the sale at any time. Corner cases:
> - What if the seller lists the same NFT twice? This can theoretically happen since they don’t transfer the NFT to the marketplace.
